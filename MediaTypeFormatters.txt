Create custom media type formatter 

When a resquest for a resource is made we sent the accept header with format such as application/xml, where when the 
resource comes back it s converted to the appropirate media type format. This is called content negotiation

There are two types of media type formatters available which are xml and json. we can extend to accept csv, xls, png, jpg etc

By default when you call a web api from IE and chrome, chrome returns response in xml and ie returns response in json
because chrome default accept header is xml and IE is json

How to Return only JSON from ASP.NET Web Api Service:

Go to Webapiconfig.cs 

config.formatter.remove(config.formatter.xmlformatter);
