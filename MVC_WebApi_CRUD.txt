MVC Web API CRUD Demo
#################################

1. Create Web Api Project

Open visual studio, click web -> ASP.NET Web Application, Give name and location -> Select Web API project 
Create another project MVC, click new project -> ASP.NET Web Application ->  Give name -> Select MVC and click ok

In real world application web api's can be consumed by windows app, mobile app, web apps and consumed as a service

2. Create Database objects

Create necessary database objects needed for the web api

3.Create EF model:

Go to VS web abi project, click on model and select add new item, select data and then ADO.NET entity data model, give model a name and then EF designer from database
Click next provide connection, select the DB objects to include and click finish. If there is error add reference to System.Data.Entity

4. Add controller for the model

Click on controller, Add new controller, Select MVC 5 controller with views, using Entity Framework
Select Model class, Data context class and Controller name and select ok

It will create the controller with Get, Put(update), Post(Insert), Delete methods

Model state validation can be done from mvc so remove it from web api

To test the project, set the web api project as start up project. To look at the web api address look at WebApiConfig.cs

Type the localhost/api/controllername to retrieve the list of employees

5. Switch to MVC project, Add controller with type as MVC 5 Controller - Empty, Name the controller

click a model for employee, reason being web api or db projects can be in differenct locations so it is recommended to create models rather than add reference

Add model class by right clicking model, add model name model as mvcEmployeeModel

Create view using MVC scaffolding, right click on the view, keep the view name the same and select template as list and model as employee model and click ok


In order to consume http methods from web api project, you need to install web api clients inside mvc project, so right click on project manage Nuget packages
search for web api client, install web api 2 client library 

In .net projects to call http methods within web api projects, we need to create http client object, you shouldn't be creating http client object for each method call
so intantite once and reuse for lifr cycle of application. If you intantiate http client object for each method call. we will run out of sockets

Create a static class  with static http client object
